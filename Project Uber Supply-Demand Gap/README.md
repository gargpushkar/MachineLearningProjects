### Problem: 
To identify the root cause of the cancellation of the rides.

### Approach:
Performed Feature Engineering to clean the data followed by Univariate & Bivariate Analysis to identify the gaps between the data. Data Visualization helped in visualizing the analysis and better understand the problem.

As a result of my analysis, I will be able to present to the client the root cause(s) and possible hypotheses of the problem(s) and recommend ways to improve them. 

### Technologies Used: 
Python, Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit, Seaborn.
